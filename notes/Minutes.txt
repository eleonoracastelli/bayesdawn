## John put everything together to analyse the Spritz data with his code.
Try to get the gap stuff wired to his code.
Has already a corner plot showing the posteriors from full data, comparing two setups.
Coalescence time is particularly off, also a bit the sky location. Probably because of the constellation response not being completely right. For one source, gets SNR = 4200. But the documentation says 2000. John will check this using the notebook that was made during data generation: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/LISA/LDC/-/blob/develop/data_generation/spritz/notebooks/MBHB_glitch_test1.ipynb
ACTION for Eleonora: will prepare a version of data with windowed gaps.
## A standard thing to want:
Instead of doing a regular FFT, we would like to have a frequency-dependent windowing.
Wide window for low frequencies, and narrow window for high frequencies.
There are 3 time scales:
Low-enough frequency : gaps not relevant at all. (Are they?)
Comparable frequencies : should be well windowed. Tapering width should be a few times the wavelength.
High frequency : the gap is large compared to it, but has to deal with the edges carefully
We could use the adaptive windowing method for all frequencies for the MBHB.
ACTION for Quentin: shall show Eleonora where the code is exactly.
We should include the windowing in the response as well.
## Records of meeting minutes
ACTION for Jake: create a fork of Bayesdawn and add the minutes in the Wiki.
